# Rich Media & Web App Development I

Notes, exercises, and more from Web Apps I

My coursework from Rich Media & Web involves front-end development using Javascript to create user-oriented webpages and software. I have utilized a variety of API's such as Canvas and WebAudio to develope fun and interactive web pages. I have reviewed and implemented topics such as ES6 standards and modules, closures, ajax, and node package manager.
