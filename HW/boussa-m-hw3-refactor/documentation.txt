- Coded in Typescript

- Changes I Made:
	- I converted all the .js filetypes to .ts
	- I strongly typed function parameters in all .ts files
	- I also strongly typed variables in .ts
	- I created an enum for DEFAULTS which stores the default values of the webpage, and moved this code into a separate defaults.enum.ts file
	- Similarly, I created a typescript interface for drawParams and moved that code into its own interface.ts file
	- The enum and interface files are imported where necessary
	- Strongly typed both the CirlceSprite and RectangleSprite classes
	- Fixed some errors due to typing and variable casting, most notably with functionality requiring use of .innerHTML
