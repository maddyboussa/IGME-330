I. I added a biquad filter node for altering the highshelf, and a lowshelf biquad filter node for altering the lowshelf. These can be altered via sliders that control the
    gain of the filter, create a sort of DJ-Table effect of slowing adjusting filter levels.

II. I created 2 sprite classes. One is called CircleSprite and draws cirlces in the center of the canvas that pulse to the beat. The other class is called RectangleSprite, 
    which is used to draw very thin bars that radiate out from the central circles.

III. In my JSON file, I included data for the page title, audio tracks, number of tracks, and user instructions / greeting. The audio tracks are contained in an array, 
    with each track having a corresponding object containing the file name, name of the track, and artist(s) for further organization. The number of tracks is recorded in order to 
    better parse the JSON data.

IV. I improved the overall aesthetics of the visualizer by streamlining and stylizing the UI. I went for a minimalist aesthetic, with black and white matching the album cover of 
    Ecco2k's album titled "E". I improved the CSS of the canvas and UI by centering the canvas and the user controls below it. Utilizing flex proprties, I ensured that the control 
    scheme was well laid out and easy to use. In terms of the aesthetics of the actual audio visualizations, I also went for a black and white minimalist theme, deviating heavily 
    from the garish and jumbled starter visualizations. Aiming for trance-like visuals rather than overly chaotic ones, I feel as if I achieved a great balance between overstimulation 
    and boredom. Additionally, I added a favicon image of the E album title for added detail.

    For this segment, I would give myself a grade of 15% as I feel as if I adequately deviated from the starter code and created an app that is very visually pleasing.
